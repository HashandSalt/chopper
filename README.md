# Kirby Chopper Plugin

This plugin creates excerpts and keeps HTML tags. This means all tags, including images. Works on characters and words.

**This is very much a beta plugin. It works (as far as I can tell!), but use at your own risk. If you find issues, let me know or make a PR if you know how to fix it :)**

## Installation

To use this plugin, place all the files in `site/plugins/chopper`.

## Usage

To trim to 200 characters and append ellipsis on the end:

```
<?= $page->text()->chopper(200, 'chars', '…') ?>
```

To trim to 50 words and append ellipsis on the end:

```
<?= $page->text()->chopper(500, 'words', '…') ?>
```

Defaults to words and an ellipsis, so if you just want 20 words and an ellipsis on the end, its shorter to write:

```
<?= $page->text()->chopper(20) ?>
```

To change the default list of kept tags, add this line to your `config.php` and amend accordingly:

```
c::set('chopper.keep', '<p><a><strong><em><sub><sup><blockquote><figure><img>');
```

## Requirements

This plugin was built using Kirby 2.5+. May work on earlier versions.

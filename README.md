# Kirby Chopper Plugin for Kirby 3

Kirby's built in [Excerpt](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/templates/field-methods/excerpt) takes an all or nothing approach to stripping html tags, and only works on characters. This plugin creates excerpts from fields via KirbyText but keeps any HTML tags, with the ability to define the tags you wish to keep. Also works on whole words, as well as characters.

To change the default list of kept tags, add this line to your `config.php` and amend accordingly:

```
